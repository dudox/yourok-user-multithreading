There are 2 possible models for a multi-threaded kafka consumer.

 - Multiple consumers with their own threads (Model #1)
    - Pros:
       - Easy to implement
       - Implementing in-order processing on per-partition is easier.
    - Cons:
       - The total of consumers is limited the total partitions of the topic. 
         The redundant consumers may not be used.
       - More TCP connections to the brokers
   
 - Single consumer, multiple worker processing threads (Model #2)
 	- Pros:
 	   - Be flexible in scale out the number of processing thread
 	- Cons:
 	   - It’s not easy to implement in-order processing on per partition. 
 	     Let’s say there are 2 messages on the same partitions being processed by 2 different threads. 
 	     To guarantee the order, those 2 threads must be coordinated somehow.
